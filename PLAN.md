- [ ] Extract all text nodes for word replacement

**Architecture:**
```typescript
// BookParser interface (Implemented)
interface IBookParser {
  parse(filePath: string): Promise<ParsedBook>;
  getChapter(index: number): Promise<Chapter>;
  getTableOfContents(): TOCItem[];
  search(query: string): SearchResult[];
}

// EPUB-specific implementation (Partially Implemented)
class EPUBParser implements IBookParser {
  // Uses JSZip for extraction
  // EPUBExtractor for ZIP/XML parsing
  // TOCParser for NCX/NAV parsing
  // MetadataExtractor for metadata
}
```

#### 2.2 Text Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Tokenize text into words
- [ ] Preserve HTML structure around words
- [ ] Handle punctuation correctly
- [ ] Support hyphenated words
- [ ] Maintain word positions for tap detection

---

### Phase 3: Translation Engine (Weeks 4-6) ⭐ CORE FEATURE

#### 3.1 Word Database Setup
- [ ] Import frequency-ranked word lists per language
- [ ] Map words to proficiency levels:
  - **Beginner (A1-A2)**: Top 500 most common words
  - **Intermediate (B1-B2)**: Words ranked 501-2000
  - **Advanced (C1-C2)**: Words ranked 2001-5000+
- [ ] Create translation pairs database

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface WordEntry {
  id: string;
  sourceWord: string;      // "house"
  targetWord: string;      // "σπίτι"
  sourceLang: Language;
  targetLang: Language;
  proficiencyLevel: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  frequencyRank: number;
  partOfSpeech: POS;
  variants: string[];      // ["houses", "house's"]
}
```

#### 3.2 Word Replacement Algorithm
- [ ] Identify replaceable words in text
- [ ] Match words accounting for:
  - Case sensitivity
  - Plural forms
  - Verb conjugations (basic)
  - Common contractions
- [ ] Respect density setting (% of words to replace)
- [ ] Avoid replacing within quotes, names, technical terms
- [ ] Ensure grammatical markers remain (articles stay English)

**Algorithm Pseudocode:**
```
function replaceWords(text, settings):
  words = tokenize(text)
  replaceable = words.filter(w => 
    dictionary.has(w) && 
    dictionary.get(w).level <= settings.proficiency
  )
  
  toReplace = selectByDensity(replaceable, settings.density)
  
  for word in toReplace:
    if shouldReplace(word, context):
      mark as foreign word with translation data
  
  return reconstructText(words)
```

#### 3.3 Context-Aware Selection
- [ ] Prefer replacing nouns and verbs (high meaning density)
- [ ] Avoid replacing words in ambiguous contexts
- [ ] Consider sentence structure
- [ ] Track replaced words to avoid repetition
- [ ] Adapt based on user's saved vocabulary

- [ ] Translation popup component:
  - Original word
  - Phonetic pronunciation (optional)
  - Save to vocabulary button
  - "I knew this" button

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Why React Native?
- Cross-platform (iOS + Android) from single codebase
- Large ecosystem and community
- Excellent performance with New Architecture
- Familiar to web developers

### Why Zustand over Redux?
- Simpler API, less boilerplate
- Better TypeScript support
- Smaller bundle size
- Sufficient for app's state needs

### Why SQLite over Realm?
- Standard SQL queries
- Better tooling and debugging
- Familiar to most developers
- Excellent performance for our use case

### EPUB Rendering Strategy
- Use WebView with epub.js for complex EPUB rendering
- Inject custom CSS for foreign word styling
- Use postMessage bridge for tap detection
- Fall back to native Text components for simple content

## 🚧 Known Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: EPUB Complexity
**Problem:** EPUBs vary wildly in structure and formatting.
**Solution:** Use battle-tested epub.js, implement fallbacks, test with diverse EPUBs.

### Challenge 2: Word Boundary Detection
**Problem:** Different languages have different tokenization rules.
**Solution:** Start with English source only, use language-specific tokenizers.

### Challenge 3: Grammatical Correctness
**Problem:** Direct word replacement can create awkward grammar.
**Solution:** Start with nouns (least grammar-dependent), expand carefully.

### Challenge 4: Performance with Large Books
**Problem:** Processing entire books at once is slow.
**Solution:** Process chapters on-demand, cache processed content.

### Challenge 5: Offline Functionality
**Problem:** Users expect to read without internet.
**Solution:** All core features work offline, sync when available.
